Hello there!

This is my first project using JavaScript, which I developped during the "Full JavaScript Course" by Udemy.
I used ES5 in this project and created a small budget web application, in which user can put all of his incomes and expenses and see his budget, percentages et'

I know that's a simple application, and I can defenitly improve it and add more features, 
however i prefer to keep following the course and move to ES6 and then I will create another projects, which will be more complex and interesting. (-:

Anyway, I feel like I've already learned a lot of cool JavaScript concepts and features and I'm very curious about the next sections of this course.
